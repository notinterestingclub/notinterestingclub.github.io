			This is our attempt at owning our own corner on the internet. A corner where we get to plaster things up to share with you when you drop by. We’re not quite sure where it’s going, but together we’ll find out. Ultimately, we just want to have some fun and hope you don’t get too bored.

			<p>At the start of each month, we’ll update you with a set of 12 things that have, for some reason or another, captivated our attention. Each time we share a new set, the old will put away…maybe never to be seen again. Maybe. Anyway, here is the first set of <i>not interesting</i> things we wanted to share with you. Welcome to the club!</p>

			<p><i>Not Interesting Club</i> wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for this short essay by Laurel Schwulst. We hope that reading this will give you some kind of inspiration to find more ownership over the web and be more intentional in how you use it.</p>

			<p>In this episode of the Center for Hebraic Thought podcast, Dr. Dru Johnson invites Dr. Byan Van Norden to share about non-western philosophy traditions and some misconceptions, to say the least, that surround them.</p>
			<p><a href="https://hebraicthought.org/podcast/asian-philosophy-bryan-van-norden/" target="_blank">Is Asian Philosophy (including Israel) “Philosophy”?</a></p>
			<p>P.S. You don’t have to really know philosophy to enjoy this one!</p>

			<p>On Sunday, August 30, we walked to Prospect Park and there were lots of people, some barbeques, loud music, and food carts as usual. We noticed that there were a couple of really tall figures a little farther away and it seemed like there were lots of people dressed in costume. They were celebrating J’ouvert. Unfortunately, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the typical parade is cancelled this year. People still found an opportunity to do something smaller in the park though. We didn’t know about the holiday before, but now we do. This brief documentary was interesting and helpful.</p>

			<p><a href="http://everynoise.com/" target="_blank">Every Noise at Once</a> is a resource for music. We don’t know exactly how it works but some say it’s an “ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 4,806 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify.”</p>
			<p>Our most widely-used function is the <a href="http://everynoise.com/everynoise1d.cgi?scope=all" target="_blank">List</a> page. You can find about any genre of music and they have a Spotify playlist for it. Once you open the playlist in Spotify (usually titled something like ”The Sound of [Genre]“), you’ll also find in the playlist description related playlists titled Intro, Pulse, Edge, etc. where you can listen to other computer-generated playlist of classics, popular titles, lesser-known tracks, and more within that genre.</p>
